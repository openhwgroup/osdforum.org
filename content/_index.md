  The Open Source Developer Forum is a workshop that brings open source SW and HW (chips, boards and systems) developers together to collaborate and learn. The OSDForum includes talks from leading industry and academic experts focused on IoT, Edge and Machine Learning development leveraging open source SW and HW building blocks. The agenda also includes a hands-on session using a CORE-V MCU open-source RISC-V core FPGA development board. Made possible by the generous support of our sponsors, the OSDForum is a non-profit event with the low fee of $25 USD for industry and academic attendees. If you do not have a CORE-V MCU open-source RISC-V core FPGA development board, you can purchase one during the registration process at a discounted rate.  
    
  The OSDForum is co-hosted by CMC Microsystem, the Eclipse Foundation and the OpenHW Group.
